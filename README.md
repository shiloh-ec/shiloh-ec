- üëã Hi, I‚Äôm @shiloh-ec
- üëÄ I‚Äôm interested in learning about the natural world and using data science and machine learning methods to model complex systems, such as human brain networks or disease risk factors. 
- üíûÔ∏è I‚Äôm interested in working with medical imaging (both large-scale population measures and individualized precision imaging), public health, and biological systems datasets.
- üß† I'm experienced with structural and diffusion-weighted neuroimaging data analysis using MATLAB and Bash/Shell scripting, and the following Neuroimaging Softwares: FMRIB Software Library (FSL), Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM), MRtrix, ITK-SNAP, Vistasoft, Automated Fiber Quantification (AFQ), & Diffusion Imaging in Python (dipy). I recently used these skills to develop novel neuroimaging techniques and analysis pipelines for imaging the human orbitofrontal cortex and olfactory nerves with very few susceptibility artifacts. With these data, I am characterizing the anatomical connectivity of the human olfactory system and orbitofrontal cortical regions involved in reward learning, sensory integration, and decision making. I am using cluster analysis methods to define distinct regions of the human orbitofrontal cortex based on anatomical connectivity with the rest of the brain.
- üëÉ I'm experienced with using R and R Markdown to manage large datasets and perform data cleaning, data mining, linear and logistic regression models, and ROC AUC analyses. I recently used these techniques to evaluate relationships between human olfactory impairment, age, and Mild Cognitive Impairment and Alzheimer's disease dementia diagnoses, using a large-scale dataset collected across nine Alzheimer's disease research centers in the United States.
- üå± I‚Äôm currently learning best practices in statistical learning and model selection, and new data science and machine learning methods in Python.
